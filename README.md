# ANALYSIS OF CMOS INVERTER WITH SCEMATIC DESIGN

CMOS Inverter â€“ Schematic & Characteristics Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on the design, schematic implementation, and analysis of the characteristics of a CMOS inverter. A CMOS inverter is a fundamental digital logic gate used in almost all modern integrated circuits due to its low static power consumption, high noise margins, and full voltage swing.
A CMOS inverter is built using one NMOS transistor and one PMOS transistor connected in a complementary fashion:
PMOS is connected to VDD (positive supply) because it conducts well when the input is low (logic 0) and passes a strong logic 1.
NMOS is connected to GND because it conducts well when the input is high (logic 1) and passes a strong logic 0.
This complementary arrangement ensures:
When the input is 0, PMOS turns ON (output = 1), and NMOS turns OFF.
When the input is 1, NMOS turns ON (output = 0), and PMOS turns OFF.
No direct path from VDD to GND exists in steady states, minimizing static power dissipation.
Key characteristics analyzed in this project include:
Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)
Noise Margins
Propagation Delay
Power Dissipation
Proper transistor sizing is also explored to achieve symmetrical switching and optimal performance.
